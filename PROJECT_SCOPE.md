# EduBridge Academy Platform - Project Scope Document

## 1. Project Overview

### Project Name
**EduBridge Academy Platform**

### Project Type
Educational information website with admin dashboard, application/enrollment management, certificate verification, and course workflow management.

### Main Goal
The goal of this project is to build a professional educational website where visitors can view faculties, courses, certificate programs, latest news, events, testimonials, and apply/enroll for courses online.

Admins will manage the full website through a secure dashboard, including faculties, courses, applications, certificates, testimonials, news/events, classes/cohorts, and verification records.

This is **not a course delivery platform** like Udemy. The website is mainly for educational information, student applications, admin management, and certificate verification.

# Part G: Security Requirements

## 49. Security Scope

The project should include basic security best practices.

### Authentication Security
- Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt
- JWT token should be signed using a secure secret key
- Protected APIs should verify JWT token
- Admin-only APIs should check user role

### API Security
- Validate all request data
- Handle errors properly
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Use CORS configuration
- Limit file upload types and sizes

### File Upload Security
- Validate file type

# 65. Final Project Scope Summary

EduBridge Academy Platform will be built using **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js with Express.js** for the backend. **Redux** will be used for frontend state management, **Axios** for API communication, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, **JWT** for authentication, **role-based authorization** for permission control, **Multer** for file uploads, **Prisma ORM** for database operations, and **MySQL** for database storage.

The system will include a public educational website and a secure admin dashboard. Public users can view faculties, courses, certificate programs, testimonials, news/events, apply for courses, subscribe to newsletters, and verify certificates. Admin users can manage all website content, faculties, courses, classes, applications, verifications, certificates, testimonials, news/events, media uploads, workflow processes, and dashboard statistics.

This project is designed as a practical, scalable, and maintainable educational website management system suitable for an institution that needs online course information, student application handling, admin control, and certificate verification.
